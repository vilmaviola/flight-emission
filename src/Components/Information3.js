              Carbon dioxide is a huge factor of global warming since the gas absorbs and radiates heat. It is a good reason to be very concerned about CO2 emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019 Sweden had an emission average of 4,45 tonnes CO2 per capita. This number can be decreased massively on an individual level if flying is reduced.
              Individual behaviour is important to decrease the individual carbon footprint and can also be of importance when it comes to impact other individuals.

        <li>Reduce flying
          <div className="info-categories-list--sublist">
            <p>
              Like mentioned above, by flying less the individual carbon footprint can be decresed massively.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes a shift of behaviour to reduce or stop flying. These type of behaviour changes are shown to be easier to handle collectively. 
              Here are some communities that can help motivate a life on the ground:
            </p>
            <p>
              Plan holidays with consideration to alternative means of transportation. 
              Fly shorter distances, fly less and try to replace flights with train, bus or car.
